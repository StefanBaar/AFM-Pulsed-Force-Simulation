# AFM-Pulsed-Force-Simulation
This repository provides an interactive Streamlit application for simulating pulsed-force atomic force microscopy (AFM) signals. It includes waveform generation, realistic noise injection, Savitzky–Golay smoothing, geometric contact-point detection, and interactive Plotly visualizations.
